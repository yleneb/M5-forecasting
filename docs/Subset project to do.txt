The goal is to complete an end to end project using all 3 of sklearn, dask, and RapidsAI, I can then move on to a new project using what I have learnt.

1. load data
2. process data
3. split into training and validation sets
4. grid search a selection of models and compare

5. get feature importances and tune model

6. Build XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
7. select the best model and train on full data, then predict
8. save the model with meta data

Repeat using Dask
Repeat using GPU
Repeat using GPU and Dask

Return to the full problem
Rebuild to use Dask and GPU
